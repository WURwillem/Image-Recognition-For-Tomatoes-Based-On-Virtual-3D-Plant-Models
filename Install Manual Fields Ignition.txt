===============================================================

1. Install Ubuntu OS. 
In this guide, we use version ubuntu-20.04.2.0-desktop-amd64.iso
Other versions are known to cause compatibility issues.
Running this from a virtual machine can cause issues due to lack of computer power, use dual boot.
Running this version of ubuntu in dual boot can cause issues with wifi drivers. Quick fix: connect phone to wifi and use hotspot via usb cable.
In the next steps, all the operations are run in terminal. 

2. Install pip 
>> sudo apt-get install python3-pip

3. Install ROS Noetic. Similar to: http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu

>> sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
>> sudo apt install curl # if you haven't already installed curl
>> curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
>> sudo apt update
>> sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full
>> source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
>> echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
>> source ~/.bashrc
>> sudo apt install python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall python3-rosinstall-generator python3-wstool build-essential
>> sudo apt install python3-rosdep
>> sudo rosdep init
>> rosdep update

4. Build catkin workspace for Fields_Ignition
>> mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws
>> mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
>> mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/build
>> mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/devel
>> cd ~/catkin_ws/src
>> catkin_init_workspace

5. Download Fields_Ignition. 
Check if in folder ~/catkin_ws/src. 
>> git clone https://github.com/azazdeaz/fields-ignition.git

6. Install and Make. 
>> cd ..
Check if in the catkin_ws folder.
>> rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
>> catkin_make

7. Set some environment variables and make your packages in that workspace recognizable to the rest of the system.
>> source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

8. Run in the catkin_ws folder. Note that both programs need to run simultaneously, because information between them is exchanged. Use two terminal windows.
Repeat step 7 in the 2nd terminal in the catkin_ws folder.

>> roslaunch fields_ignition field.launch world_dir:=$(rospack find fields_ignition)/generated_examples/tomato_field
>> roslaunch fields_ignition ground_truth.launch world_dir:=$(rospack find fields_ignition)/generated_examples/tomato_field

9. To generate new tomato fields install Blender and upgrade jupyterhub. Blender 2.90 is compatible.
>> sudo snap install blender --channel=2.90/stable --classic
>> pip install --upgrade jupyterhub
>> pip install --upgrade --user nbconvert

10. Run notebook to generate fields. When parameters in the second field are changed the dimensions of the field can be adapted.
>> rosrun fields_ignition tomato_gen_notebook

Note: sometimes there is error about "Error: Not freed memory". This is a bug of Blender. It seems the error does not affect the results.
